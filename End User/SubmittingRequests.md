#   Submitting Requests

The main purpose of the privacy platform is to allow you to submit requests to applications and determine what information that application has on you.  To learn more about the types of requests, see [Requests](Requests.md).

Keep in mind that not every application (due to API or design limitations) will support all types of requests.
