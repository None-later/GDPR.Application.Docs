A device is a combination of a user agent and ip address.  To protect your data and to increase security, you must verify every device you use to login to the privacy platform.  Only after you have verified the device will you be allowed to continue.

In some cases, your device and ip address may be used in remote applications to identify you.  Although not every applicaiton supports seraching based on device and ip address, you will likely see this data in the exports you get from companies and their applications.
