# Profile - Social Identities

Social identities are exactly that, identities you have on social networks such as facebook, twitter and instagram.  There are several ways to validate these types of accounts, but our preferred way is through [KeyBase](/KeyBase.md).

##  Validating Social Identities

We utilize keybase.io (why write things that have already been written?) to verify social identities. 

### What is Keybase?

Reference [KeyBase.md](Keybase.md)

### How does Keybase work?

KeyBase is based on PGP security and "proofs".  A proof is something only you would know and post to a social media account based on the private key in your keybase.io account.  Once you have done this, it is verified that your keybase.io account owner is the owner of the target social media account (although doesn't really prove your identity in general).
