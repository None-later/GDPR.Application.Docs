# Messages

The platform supports two types of messages: application and subject.  Messages allow us or companies that your data is tied to to contact you about any number of things from changes to a privacy policy to potential breaches of their systems.

##  Application Messgaes

An application message is a message directed at all registered or discovered individuals in a particular application.  If you wanted to see the history of a breaches or any important notices the owner of the application needed to tell every, this is where you would see those messages.

##  Subject Messages

These messages are directly solely at you.  Typically these are messages that are in response to a request you have sent.  For example, you may receive a message that your request has completed processing and points you to the download link.  You could also receive a message that is more of a status update of your request such as pending approval or application is processing.
