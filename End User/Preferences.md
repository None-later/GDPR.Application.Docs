# Preferences

The privacy platform has a small number of profile preferences that you can set.  There could be more added later, but the current set are:

-   Langauge Setting:  this allows you to set where your language setting comes from.  If you computer/browser is set to Spanish, we would use that preference; otherwise you can select to use your profile language setting no matter what your computer or browser settings are.
-   Language: This is your prefered language setting.  The privacy platform has been auto-translated into several different langauges.  Although not perfect and we will continue to "adjust" the translations, it should make using the platform a bit easier for those not familiar with English.
-   Default Notification Method:  This is how we will contact you in the event we need to send you a message.  You can also set the "primary" of each of the notification types.
