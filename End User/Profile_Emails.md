# Profile - Emails

This is the most common form of identification for an application or a data subject.  Most users have a fair amount of control of their email and it can be easily verified.  Man in the middle or impersonation attacks are always possible, but in most cases, you can rely that the person that is able to verify an email has control of it.

In some cases, a hacker may have gained access to a person's email and taken it over.  In this case, tenants can configure their environment to require more than one type of data verification.

##  Validating Emails

Emails are validated by sending a code to the email address.  You must enter the code in order to proceed with any operations.  

In some cases you will be required to have at least one verified email address in order to submit requests.
