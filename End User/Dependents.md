# Dependents

A dependent can be your children or any legal dependent that has a valid power of attorney.  Dependents are like creating a seperate account yet you are able to switch your context to their account to make requests on their behalf.

##  Children

If you would like to submit requests based on known email addresses of your children, you may do so by creating a dependent account and then executing request on their behalf.  Most companies and applications have strict rules against allowing children under the age of 13 from participating.  If you feel like their data may be stored in an application, this will allow you to query and then request the data be deleted.

##  Power Of Attorney

A legal power of attorney (POA) from a lawyer in good standing where they hold their license is required in order to add any dependent accounts.  You will be required to upload or email proof and pay a fee that covers the verification of the POA document.  Check our pricing page for the latest costs for POA verification.
