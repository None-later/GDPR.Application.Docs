# Applications

We provide several application "stubs" for tenants to create connections to their particular instances.  These stubs are continually developing and evolving.  Most large SaaS or on-premises applcations have well defined and mature APIs, however others are young and not so well evolved.  

We do our best to keep up with these evolving APIs, but software changes very quickly and it is possible these APIs change or break over time.
