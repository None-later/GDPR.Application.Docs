# Profile - Government Identities

Government identities include items such as Driver's license, social security number or passport number, etc.

##  Validating Identities

Validation requires you to temporarily upload the document to the system for processing, then a series of in-house and 3rd party verifications will occur to ensure that you are in fact the owner of that particular identity.
