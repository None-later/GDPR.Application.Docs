#   Deleting Your Account

At any time you may submit a request to have your account deleted.  However, in some cases we will have to keep any data you have used to submit requests to any companies or applications.  This is to prevent against fraud and to support our reporting and compliance activities.

##  What will prevent my account from being deleted?

If you submit any time of request to an application other than the ["Core"](./Applications/TODO/README.md) applcation, you account will need to be kept for at least one year, after which we will automatically delete it.
