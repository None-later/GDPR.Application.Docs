# Consents

Companies and their applications require your consent to market to you or to sell your data to other companies.  Typically consent is solely based on acceptance of an applications terms and privacy policies.

##  Types of Consent

There are two types of consents in the privacy platform.  You may select from either of the two and the appropirate settings will be passed to the company or their application.

-   Full Consent:  You will allow them to contact you with their own marketing activities and be able to sell your data to others
-   Partial Consent:  You only allow the actual company or application to utlize your data to contact you.  They are not allowed to sell you data.

##  Removing your Consent

-   You can remove your consent from an application at any time, however to prevent individuals from abusing the system, you are limited to sending a consent message to every 90 days.
