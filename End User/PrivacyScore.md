# Privacy Score

Privacy Central, Inc. has developed a series of calculations to determine the privacy level of a company and/or application.  This set of over 75+ data points (some of which give negative scores), allows us to calaculate just how secure or privacy centric an application or company is.

Based on our metrics, you can gain a perspective of just how serious a company takes their privacy and security stance.

##  What is it based upon?

The algorithm and calculations are a propriatary secret to Privacy Central, Inc. but we analyze several factors including:

-   Privacy Policies
-   Usage Terms
-   Many, many other things (technology and business-based)
