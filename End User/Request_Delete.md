# Delete

A delete operation will remove your consents and data from any applicable "records" in the target system.  Records that must be kept based on policy will not be deleted and must be kept based on the requirements in the policy.

For example, if you have a contract that is valid for the next five years, a company must keep your information and the contract data until the end of the contract and likely for at least 7 years after the contract end date.

Any information tied to that contract will not be elibible for deletion.

##  Performing an Delete

You can submit a delete request to any application or tenant, but based on the requirements above, that data may or may not be deleted.
