# Update

Update requests will take your "primary" data point and update any verified records you have to match that data point.  If the application cannot "merge" your data, you will still have two or more accounts in the target system.

##  Performing an Update

You should set any personal data to "primary" when you submit an update.  As with any request, you get one of these per year and not every application will support an "update" command.  

Tenants however have a "manual" application that will allow them to update your data when appropriate.  In most cases you will be redirected to update your information via the application's UI.
