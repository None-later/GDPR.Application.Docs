# Profile - Biometrics

Biometerics are particlly supported by the privacy platform, however most applications will not have this type of data to search against.  

This does not mean that you may not recieve it in your query requests.

##  Types of Biometrics

There are several ways to verify an identity based off biometerics, these include:

-   Finger prints
-   Facial
-   Voice print
-   Eye / Retina scan
-   Palm print

##  Validating Biometrics

Biometerics are very difficult to validate today.  Due to the small amount of applications that require or support biometric data, it is very unlikely that you will need to upload any of your biometeric data.
