# Privacy Central Privacy Score

Privacy Central's main goal is to make privacy a first-class citizen for all organziations and applications.  In order to do this we must drive awareness of the large issues that revolve around privacy including a company's privacy and terms of use policies.

Based on 75+ factors, Pirvacy Central will build a privacy profile of a company and its applications which will guide you on how safe you should consider your data on a particular application.

You can find the privacy score for several of our supported application stubs on the footer "Applications" link on the privacy platform portals.
