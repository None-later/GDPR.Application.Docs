# Record Types

Some applications support the notion of "Records".  A Record is a type of data that the system may export.  

For example, for [Microsoft Dynamics](./Applications/), it defines several types of records:

-   Account
-   Contact
-   Contract
-   Lead

For each record type you can define a [Record Policy](RecordPolicies.md).
