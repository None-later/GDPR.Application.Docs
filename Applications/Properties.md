# Properties

Every application has a set of properties that help drive how it interacts with the platform and its backend.

##  Core Properties

The platform will add a set of common properties to every application created.  These cannot be deleted and will always have a default value.  These properties include:

|    |            |
| ----------|:-------------:|
| **Name** | **Type** | **Default Value** |
|Azure AD | TODO | TODO |

##  Custom Properties

Custom properties are added via the Application Stub through the [GetEntityPropertyDefinitions](./SDK/EntityProperties.md) method.
