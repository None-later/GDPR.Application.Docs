# Delete an Application

Only applications that have not have any request submitted against them can be deleted immediately.  This is to ensure compliance and pevent fraud and is defined in your terms of service.

##  What happens to Data Subjects?

If a data subject is only tied to one application and it is the one you are attempting to delete, and they have no pending requests, they will also be deleted from the system.

##  How long before it deletes?

Whatever is the last request date for any request other than a "consent" request, will be used as the date from which we will calculate one year.

After one year from this data, we will delete the application and any data tied too it.

##  Can I prevent more requests?

Absolutely, you can set the "Is Public" property of the application to "False".  This will make the application not visible to anyone using the consume web of  the platform.
