# Data Partners

Data partners are individuals that you have sold data too.  In the event that one of your data subjects make a request to remove consent or be deleted from your application, you will need to notify all your downstream partners of the deletion.

##  Adding Data Partners

You can add a data partner by email or phone number. 

##  Notifying Data Partners

When a request is processed by the privacy platform, any applications that have a data partner will be notified via application message and email/phone.  They will be provided a link to the [resource token ](ResourceToken.md)based page that will show the data the data subject requested to be deleted.
