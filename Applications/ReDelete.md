# Re-Delete

One of the core features of the privacy platform is to be able to re-process already submitted deletion requests.  

This is important for when you perform a backup on your application and previously deleted records are brought back into existance.

A data subject has to specifcally check the "Re-Delete" checkbox when they submit a deletion request in order for the re-delete to be executed on a deletion request.
