# Messages

When you want to send a generic message to all your application data subjects (and not targeted at one specific user), you can do so through the Messages actions.

When you create a message you can set the following items:

-   Importantance level
-   Public viewing
-   Title
-   Ivr Message
-   Url
-   PdF File Url
-   Body

##  Translations

As part of the privacy platform, you can also utlize automated message translation.  This is based on Microsoft and (or Amazon in case of failover) translation services.

These systems are not perfect and are simply provided as a helpful feature of the platform to do a preliminary translation.  Once you have translated a message, you can then browse to each of the different translated version and modify them.

##  Sending Messages

When you send a message, it will be sent through the privacy platform layers such that it shows on a user's Application Messages page and they will be notified via their language and notification [preferences](./End User/Preferences.md).

You will be showen how much it will cost you to submit a message based on these settings.
